        <h1>Building a website using HTML and CSS</h1>
        <article>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>I like to work from the top down so I start with the header. I found a logo on a free image site and touched up all my margins and paddings to give my header an almost ready look</p>

            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>After using Google to find minimalist templates for websites I found this one. It looks like it was made by a developer named Franklina. Unfortunately, the link to her site is down. But that’s ok because we’re just going to use this as a reference.</p>
            <img src="image4.png">
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Here I just snapped a quick picture at my desk, rearranged my header text, and organized my about me section so that it is slimmer and sits next to the image. All that’s left now is the final touch ups by adding a body, background, and getting the spacing just right.</p>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>This is the blank slate. To start the website I create the basic needs. A header, a footer, and a main section. I then make colored borders around them so I can see them easily. This will help me rearrange things later.</p>
            <img src="image1.png" id="img1">
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>Here I split the main section into a navigation menu and an about me. I try to plan the navigation menu early as I know I will need it. I write the text on an actual word document for spell check then copy/paste. I still don’t know what my website will look like so I’m going to go on Google and look for ideas.</p>
            <img src="image3.png" id="img3">
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>I got rid of the light gray background color so I could see how I liked it in white. Now that I have an example to work with I can get to work on replicating it. We don’t want it to be the exact same but the general layout is easy. It has a very small header, a large picture, a short about me, and links at the bottom. So all I will do now is rearrange my sections close to where they need to be.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>For the final touch-ups I simply remove the borders, add a background to the body and html, then begin spacing my elements where I want them. In an effort to make the site look similar to Franklina’s I crunched the text in the about me and sized/centered it with the image. This is just a rough draft and will likely go through changes as I make the rest of the site using the same template.</p>
