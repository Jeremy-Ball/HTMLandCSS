    	  <h3>Step 1</h3>
    	  <p>The first thing I do is create a background color for the HTML document and a background color for the body of the website. This helps me visualize the contents of the website. Since I'm using Flexbox, I create a border around the container (red) then a black border around each item I will need. The basic layout of my design is simple with a header, a footer, and the main content in between. By setting it all up in the beginning I can play around with margins and prepare the website for responsive design.</p>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p> Here I add the appropriate text in each box. My header will stay the same across the rest of my pages so I finish that first. After, I will set the margins, text sizes, padding, etc. It's still in a very rough stage but I can spend a while at this step deciding how I want my header to look. I might want to add a banner background, a logo, or even work on my navigation links and have them complete before I work on the rest of the page.

  	    <h3>Step 3</h3>
  	    <p>When I'm satisfied that the header and footer look the way I want I will remove the borders. The borders themselves will throw off the size of the flex items. Now I can resize them exactly the way I want and leave them while I work on other parts of the site. The header and footer can still be edited later, but now I can quickly throw up other pages on my website without having to worry about those two parts.

  	    <h3>Step 4</h3>
  	    <p>I decided to work on the article first. I set the headings, paragraphs, and quotation with appropriate margins and padding. These can be edited later but now I have a good idea of what the end result of my site will be. After I pick a picture I can remove borders and touch up the margins to make it fit neatly together.
